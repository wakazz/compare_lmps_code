# compare_lmps_code - NONE OF THIS IS MY CODE.
Modified code belongs to: https://github.com/matsubara0/lammps
----
Want to use GitHub's method of comparing changes to source code.

Loaded in relevant Lammps files -> changes commited -> visual representation of changes implemented. Easier than using the 'diff' command due to the large and numerous files.
